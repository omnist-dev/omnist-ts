# YAML

`readYaml`/`writeYaml`/`checkYaml` (`src/formats/yaml.ts`, built on the
optional `yaml` peer dependency).

YAML is closer to the Document model than JSON -- it has native date/
timestamp scalars -- but shares JSON's array/object shape, so the same
same-label-edges-collapse-to-an-array mapping and count-1 fallback apply.
Pass `{ schema }` to `readYaml` to disambiguate and to upgrade leaves the
same way `readJson`/`readToml`/`readXml` do.

```ts
import { readYaml, writeYaml, checkYaml } from "@omnist-dev/omnist";

const node = readYaml("name: Ann\ntag:\n  - x\n  - y\n");
writeYaml(node);
```
